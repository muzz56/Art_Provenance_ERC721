### Art_Provenance_ERC721

#### Description:

This is a project on Digitized Art_Work based on ERC721-NFT tokens. These NFT tokens can be used to represent the digital ownership of artwork. Suppose, when the owner of artwork issues a token-ID, along with the original author's information, the token can be used to track the entire transaction records when the artwork ownership is transferred to its current owner. Moreover, the other attributes that can also be attached to the token for tracing are the artist's info, the painting title or theme, a good description, and sales deed too.

This was developed using Remix IDE and Truffle environment.
